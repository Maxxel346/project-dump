# Gofile Downloader

A simple script to download files from **Gofile** using the `requests` approach.  
Currently, the script will **download all files inside a Gofile folder** automatically.

---

## Notes
- Needs an update to allow selecting **which file(s)** to download when multiple are available  
- Works fine for single files or when downloading everything in bulk  
- Experimental and may break if Gofile changes its API or response structure

## Status
ðŸš§ **Unfinished / Work in Progress** ðŸš§  
Next step: implement file selection for multi-file folders.
