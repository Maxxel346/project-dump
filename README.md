# project-dump

A personal dump for mini projects, half-finished experiments, and random ideas.  
This repo is a parking lot for things that:

- Aren’t ready to be implemented  
- May become part of a bigger project later  
- Or just need a place to live before being forgotten  

Think of it as a **sandbox + archive** for code that doesn’t (yet) deserve its own repo.

---

## Purpose
Instead of losing track of unfinished work, everything lands here first.  
That way:  
- Nothing gets lost  
- Ideas stay accessible  
- Future projects can pick up these scraps  

---

## Notes
- Expect messy, incomplete, or experimental code  
- Don’t expect full documentation or polished implementations  
- Some parts may never be finished (and that’s okay)
