# Mediafire Downloader

A simple script to download files from **Mediafire** using the `requests` library.  
This is part of my `project-dump` collection – so it’s experimental and not production-ready.

## Features
- Fetches a Mediafire link and extracts the real download URL  
- Downloads the file directly via `requests`  
- Minimal dependencies (just `requests`)
